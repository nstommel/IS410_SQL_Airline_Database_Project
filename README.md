# IS410_SQL_Airline_Database_Project
This project contains the implementation of an airline database in Oracle SQL with queries and data. This project is an exercise in creating a functional relational database with a good structure.

For this project, I created a database model for an imaginary airline company to do the following tasks:<br/>
-Track airline customers and contact information.<br/>
-Store records of each flight.<br/>
-Keep track of physical plane inventory and plane attributes.<br/>
-Store customer reviews for each flight to better gauge where to improve services.<br/>
-Keep records for each employee and what flights they have served on.<br/>
-Keep a history of tickets/boarding passes for each customer on each flight.<br/>

A full entity relationship (ER) diagram as well as a normalized relational model is provided below:
